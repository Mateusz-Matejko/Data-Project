# Situation on flat rental market in Gdansk 
### project still in progress... 

As a student living in beautful polish city - Gdansk. I took oportunity to analyse the situation on flat renatal market during the peroid of high demand and possible changes.

From September 3rd to this day im every week i am collecting data via Selenium library from the moast popular advertising service in Poland 
(olx). The data collected is holding details about sepecific rental offer like: 
- Building type
- Furnished
- Level 
- Link to offer
- Negotiable
- Private owner
- Publish date
- rent for owner
- rent extra 
- rent full
- rooms
- surface
- Title of listing 

I belive that detail of data and the certain peroid of time with high demand, also combinded with few other factors like: 
- high inflation rate in Poland
- the begginign of student's year ( in October )
- and limited amount of flats avilable.

may lead me to interesting conclusion.


With all the data collectted than and help of Pandas python library i am analysing all the data and im going ot visualise that.
